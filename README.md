Emscripten project site: http://emscripten.org

FCEUX project site: http://www.fceux.com/


### OVERVIEW ###

The goal of em-fceux is to enable FCEUX in the modern web browsers.
This means real-time frame rates and interactivity at around 60 fps,
high-quality visuals, support for audio, battery-backed save RAM, save
states and gamepads.

Additional goal is to emulate late 80's / early 90's console gaming
experience by providing NTSC signal and CRT TV emulation and a
"game stack" in the client/browser.


### FEATURES ###

em-fceux contains major modifications to make the FCEUX code more suitable
for Emscripten and web browsers. It also adds a new Emscripten driver that
uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering. This enables the use of shaders to
emulate NTSC signal and analog CRT TV output.

New features:

* Optimizations to achieve around 60 fps interactivity in web browsers
* NTSC composite video emulation
* CRT TV emulation

Notable supported FCEUX features:

* Both NTSC and PAL system emulation
* Save states and battery-backed SRAM
* Speed throttling
* Audio
* Support for two game controllers
* Zapper support
* Support for gamepads/joysticks
* Custom keyboard bindings
* Support for .nes, .zip and .nsf file formats

Notable *unsupported* FCEUX features:

* New PPU emulation (old PPU emulation is used for performance)
* FDS disk system
* VS system
* Special peripherals: Family Keyboard, Mahjong controller etc.
* Screenshots and movie recording
* Cheats, TAS features and Lua scripting


### BUILD ###

em-fceux is built under Linux or Unix. Windows is not currently supported.

First install Emscripten 1.32.0 (tested) by following instructions in:
http://emscripten.org/

Then you also need scons build tool, gzip and Python 2.7.x. Their installation
depends on the operating system.

Build the source with ./embuild.sh script in the em-fceux directory root.

Release build: ./embuild.sh RELEASE=1

Debug build: ./embuild.sh RELEASE=0


### RUN / DEPLOY ###

After successfull build, the src/drivers/em/deployment/ directory will
contain the em-fceux "binaries": fceux.js, fceux.js.mem, fceux.data and
their respective gzipped versions. To deploy, copy all the contents of
the deployment directory to the server. Please modify or omit the
.htaccess and robots.txt files depending on your site configuration.

To test em-fceux locally, run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' in the
src/drivers/em/deployment/ directory. Then navigate web browser to
http://localhost:8000/

Please refer to em-fceux help (the '?' icon) for help.

### TECHNICAL ###

em-fceux utilizes web browser client-side storage (Emscripten IndexedDB
file system) to store the games, save data and save states. None of these
are ever transmitted out from the client/browser.

Emulator settings and keyboard bindings are stored in localStorage.
Web Audio API is used for the audio.

em-fceux implements NTSC signal emulation by modeling the composite YIQ
output. The separation of YIQ luminance (Y) and chrominance (IQ/UV) is
achieved with a technique known as "1D comb filter" which reduces chroma
fringing compared to band or low-pass methods (and is also simple to
implement). Under the hood, YIQ to RGB conversion relies on a large lookup
table (texture) which is referenced in a fragment shader.
